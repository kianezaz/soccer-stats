# yelp-comparator
A simple web scraping app that uses Beautiful Soup library and Yelp as the target website. This program can be run on the command line.

This web scraper is used to compare prices and ratings of restauraunts across two distinct cities of your choice that serve comparable foods. Once the web scraper collects the data from Yelp based on your input, the program will open a web page with a summary of its findings.

As an example, the program can be used to compare the prices and ratings of restaurants that serve pizza in San Diego and Chicago.
